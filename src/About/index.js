            <p id='pg'>Credit score is a critical factor that influences the ability of one to get approved for loans,
                 credit cards, mortgages and other forms of credit, as well as the interest rates and terms they receive.
                 We provide a credit scoring system that generates a credit score based on information such as regular utility payments,
                 savings, farmers' milk collections and other sources of income, to assess their creditworthiness. </p>
